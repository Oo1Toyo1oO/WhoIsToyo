It's shocking how powerful the visual programming language of that series is, i wished it would've been on pc and allowed you to export your games but sadly everything that you create in it is locked to inside of the game.</p><p>In the meantime they've also released another engine-game called "Dreams" but at this point i wasn't dedicated to fully learning that anymore, it also has the exact same problems as its predecessor.<br><br>So now i'm starting to learn "real" game developement engines and im going to document my progress and everything between inside of my blogs in the hopes that it may help somebody else and also for myself. In addition to that i am also going to showcase my already existing game projects on here and provide some insights into their creation processes.<br><br>At this point i am also running a custom server for the aforementioned game series as the official servers have (unsurprisingly) been shut down. I'm using open source software for this, which is convenient for me as i'm actually not very experienced in networking. We also have a relatively big team at this point alongside a Discord Server, it's my most successful project by far so there will be a seperate page dedicated to it.<br><br>I also have an (inactive) YouTube channel and a lot more social media, almost all of which you'll be able to find on my social media page. I'm also learning html and css right now so this website will definitely improve in functionality and design as time goes on and i gain more experience. Oh, and im also bilingual, i speak both german and english fluently and see both as my "native" languages, since i've grown up learning both. I use English primarily though, for pretty much everything that doesn't involve speaking with people in real life (including thinking most of the time) as i live in Germany.<br><br>Anyway, i hope that's enough of an introduction and that you'll enjoy following my journey!</p><div class="post__meta post__meta--author"><a href="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/authors/toyo/" class="feed__author">Toyo</a></div></div></header></div><div class="feed"><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/authors/toyo/" class="feed__author">Toyo</a> <time datetime="2024-06-16T17:35" class="feed__date">June 16, 2024</time></div><h2><a href="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/how-i-manage-to-never-ever-burn-out.html">How i manage to never ever burn out.</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Im just too based for that tbh.</p><a href="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/how-i-manage-to-never-ever-burn-out.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://x.com/Oo1Toyo1oO" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@toyo8460" aria-label="Youtube"><svg><use xlink:href="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>2024 Toyo</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
