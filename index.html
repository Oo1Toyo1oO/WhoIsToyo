It's shocking how powerful the visual programming language of that series is,<br>i wished it would've been on pc and allowed you to export your games but sadly everything<br>that you create in it is locked to inside of the game.<br><br>In the meantime they've also released another engine-game called "Dreams" but at this<br>point i wasn't dedicated to fully learning that anymore, it also has the exact same problems<br>as its predecessor.<br><br>So now i'm starting to learn "real" game developement engines and im going to document my progress<br>and everything between inside of my blogs in the hopes that it may help somebody else and also for myself.<br>In addition to that i am also going to showcase my already existing game projects on here and provide<br>some insights into their creation processes.<br><br>At this point i am also running a custom server for the aforementioned game series as the official servers<br>have (unsurprisingly) been shut down. I'm using open source software for this, which is convenient for me<br>as i'm actually not very experienced in networking. We also have a relatively big team at this point alongside<br>a Discord Server, it's my most successful project by far so there will be a seperate page dedicated to it.<br><br>I also have an (inactive) YouTube channel and a lot more social media, almost all of which you'll be able to<br>find on my social media page. I'm also learning html and css right now so this website will definitely<br>improve in functionality and design as time goes on and i gain more experience.<br>Oh, and im also bilingual, i speak both german and english fluently and see both as my "native"<br>languages, since i've grown up learning both. I use English primarily though, for pretty much everything<br>that doesn't involve speaking with people in real life (including thinking most of the time) as i live in Germany.<br><br>Anyway, i hope that's enough of an introduction and that you'll enjoy following my journey!</p><ul class="actions"><li><a href="#header" class="button icon solid solo fa-arrow-down scrolly">Continue</a></li></ul></div><header id="header"><a class="logo" href="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/">WhoIsToyo?</a></header><nav id="nav"><ul class="icons"><li><a href="https://x.com/Oo1Toyo1oO" class="icon brands fa-x-twitter"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@toyo8460" class="icon brands fa-youtube"><span class="label">YouTube</span></a></li></ul></nav><main id="main"><section class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2024-06-16T17:35" class="date">June 16, 2024</time><h2><a href="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/how-i-manage-to-never-ever-burn-out.html">How i manage to never ever burn out.</a></h2></header><p>Im just too based for that tbh.</p><ul class="actions special"><li><a href="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/how-i-manage-to-never-ever-burn-out.html" class="button">Full Story</a></li></ul></article></section></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>Â© Toyo 2024</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
