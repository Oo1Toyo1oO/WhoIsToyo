Hopefully it helped some people.</p>\n<p>Even though this isn't supposed to be a regular game, i still made sure that it had a nice design thats consistent across the whole level and that everything was presented well.

In the game you there are 2 maps you can choose, one being space based, one being canyon based and every few seconds the ground turns into lava (or starts burning to be more exact) and you have to jump onto the objects in your enviroment to survive, as time goes on more and more objects dissapear so it gets harder and harder to survive.</p>\n<p>There are also rewards for hitting certain score milestones, the score increases every time you survive a wave. It's a pretty neat little game that has quite a bit of replayability. In retrospect we could have definitely expanded on it by adding more maps, adding a shop with upgrades to add more depth to the gameplay etc but it's fine the way it is.</p>",

I recorded the last live event on YouTube.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BFYlNUGuG_g?si=_QLfbHmXrntPzimb\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>A problem with these live events would be that they weren't officially supported by the engine and game platform i used (LittleBigPlanet) so i had to do some workarounds to get it to work (i even faked interaction between other players on the server), there wasn't actually a server being updated live, in reality i updated the whole game a bit before the announced live event would start, knowing that the players of the old version will have been kicked out of the game by now, since the game ends eventually, as i mentioned. So that new build would contain the live event and after the live event is over the players would either be transfered to an unlisted version of the newest build with all of the changes made by the live event being in effect, the new map etc, or the changes would just be done on the live event build they're currently on too, then i updated the build while they were still in the game to the post-live event version, so if they'd leave the game and rejoin they woudn't see the live event again and instead the aftermath of the event that happened.</p>\n<p>The problem with this is: what would happen if a player joined right before the live event was to start but after i already updated to the live event build, they would be slightly out of sync, but thats not even that bad, the real issue lies within what would happen if someone decided to restart the level or leave it during the event and rejoin, the live event would repeat!</p>\n<p>Anyway, i dont think that ever really happened though, so thats good. Eventually the final live event lead up to the entire map being destroyed and <a href=\"https://oo1toyo1oo.github.io/WhoIsToyo/real-life-rpg-2.html\">Real life RPG 2</a> to come out!</p>",
